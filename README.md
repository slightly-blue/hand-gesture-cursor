# hand-gesture-cursor
 Experimentation with different methods to convert hand gestures to mouse events. Not limited to any specific programing language or packages.

- Google MediaPipe as base


## Three Directions

1. **npm module** 
  - will only work in the confined space of a webapp  
  - might be very slow
  - can be deployed to a website in order to collect feedback

2. **Python program** 
  - will work in any program
  - real world use can be tested

3. **C++ program**
  - will work in any program
  - better performance than python
  - more developer time, less libraries, less knowledge 

## Plan

- `Python`: *(PoC and testing)*
- `C++`: *(End product, probably out of scope for my research)*
